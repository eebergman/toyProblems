// Part one:
// Create a function that will return an array of six randomly generated
// numbers that are between 1 and 60.

// Part two:
// Create a function that will use setTimeout to console.log each number in
// the generated array in a dramatic fashion. For example, have the function
// console.log each number in the array every two seconds. Maybe the last
// number, or powerball, after an extra few seconds to make it extra dramatic.

// Part three (black diamond):
// Use clearTimeout in some way. Maybe build some functionality that will allow
// you to stop all the setTimeouts, like if there was an urgent news bulletin
// that interrupted the powerball drawing. Or, have an option to that will allow
// you to be able to console.log each item in the lotto array without waiting
// for the setTimeout.
