// write a function that finds the common factors of two numbers,
// and returns them sorted from highest to lowest.
// example with 12 and 18:
// factors of 12 are 12, 6, 4, 3, 2, 1
// factors of 18 are 18, 9, 6, 3, 2, 1
// so the common factors of 12 and 18 are 6, 3, 2, 1
// another example: console.log(commonFactors(20, 25)) // => [5, 1]
